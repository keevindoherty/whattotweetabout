This is where I post the fun Twitter stuff that I work on whenever my requests aren't being rate limited :D

Lots of updates have been made to this project, and I will push when I get the time, including:
1. Twitter Semantic analysis in R (done)
2. Markov chain tweet generation in Python (in progress)
3. Toy pagerank implemenation for Twitter in R (will post ASAP, haven't had a lot of time lately to put into it :( )
